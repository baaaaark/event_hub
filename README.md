# Event Hub

This is an event hub built for automation of the home, providing a hub/repo for all alarms, timers, and notifications of the home.

## Description

As a minimally-viable product, the project will record the events of the household into an SQLite database, while printing console lines to notify of alarms.

## Project Idea

Ultimately, this will provide a hub that will record many types of data, including timers, kitchen thermometers, household thermostats, moisture meters for plants, and many other sensor-based activities.  Creating a system like this will eventually allow for the creation of a automatically-generated log and daily agenda for the home, accessible from anywhere.

## Future Improvements / Priority List

1. Create an appropriate abstract model for all data types.
2. Improve GET functions to allow for viewing of all timers and other sensor data from any device in the household.
3. Write testing as needed
